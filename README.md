# Welcome to Tic Tac Toe Game two players
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to be the first to form a line of three of your marks (either X or O) on a 3x3 grid. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Game Rules:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
One player uses X and the other uses O.
Players take turns placing their marks in an empty square.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
